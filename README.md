# CSCI151
The first assignment for Computer Science
1. [20 points] Find the base of the natural logarithm (denoted by e).

Write a program that, for an integer k given as input, computes the approximation of the
value of e to the first k terms of this formula when k is positive.
Your program will keep prompting the user to provide values of k and computing e until
the value of k provided by the user is negative or zero.
For example if the user provides number 1, the output is:
number: 1 and the program still prompting user to provide next input, if it is 2,
then next output 2, if the input 3 then 2.5 and so on.

2. [20 points] An integer is called palindrome if its reverse equals the number itself. For
example, 12321, 44, 9889 are all palindrome numbers while 1233, 45, 876 are not. Write
a program that takes an integer as input and outputs whether it is a palindrome or not
along with its reverse. For example if the user provides number 12345, the output is:
number: 12345, reverse: 54321, Not palindrome.
